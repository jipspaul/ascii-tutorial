# Image to ASCII Art Converter

![Sample ASCII Art](sample_ascii_art.png)

This Python script allows you to convert an image to ASCII art. It takes an input image, resizes it, and then converts it to ASCII characters based on the pixel darkness. The resulting ASCII art can be saved to a text file and also previewed in the console.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pillow library (Python Imaging Library fork)

You can install the Pillow library using the following command:

```bash
pip install pillow
